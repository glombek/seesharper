# Getting afloat

## 1. Sign up for an account at [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu)

Scratch is a graphical way to help us start thinking like a developer. Sign up so we can save our work.

## 2. Sign up for an account at [github.com](https://github.com)

Github is a popular free "source control" platform. It let's us store our code online with backups.

Although Scratch will let us save our work on their own platform, we're going to store it on Github too so that all our work is in one place (even when we move away from Scratch).

## 3. Load the project info [go.joe.gl/getafloat](https://go.joe.gl/getafloat)

We're going to make a game!

## 4. Discuss our goals

What do we want to get out of this? Why are you here?

## 5. Let's get started with Scratch!

We'll work through the project together

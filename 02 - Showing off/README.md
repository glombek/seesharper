# Showing off

We're going to make a little website for you to show off your boat game.



## 1. Create a new Github repository

Log into the Github account you created last time and create a new repository. Name it `username.github.io` where *username* is your username on GitHub. **Tick the "Initialize this repository with a README" box.**

## 2. Make some files

Create a new file in your repository and call it `games/boat/index.html`. An HTML file is a file containing HTML (what the web is made of).

Put the following in your HTML file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
    <h1>
        Boat game
    </h1>
	<!-- Your game will go here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. Embed your boat game

Find your game in your Scratch account and copy the embed code, sticking it into your HTML where the comment tells you to.

## 4. Showing off

Open this link (swapping out your username) *username*.github.io/games/boat

## 5. Custom domain

Let's register a custom domain. We'll let you use:

- *yourname*.mingo.pink
- *yourname*.indv.uk
- Register your own .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf or .gq for free at [Freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com)
- Buy a domain of your choice - .com, .uk, .me etc
- Use a subdomain on a domain you already own (e.g. `code.katherine-louise.com`)

Set your domain to point to Github ([go.joe.gl/ghurl](https://go.joe.gl/ghurl)). I'll help with this.

In your Github repository settings, set your custom domain to your new domain name (and enable HTTPS).

**You can now share your game anyone (with a pretty custom URL) ðŸ˜Š**
